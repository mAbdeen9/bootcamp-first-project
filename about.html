                        <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
                        <p> The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of
                            Louisiana, including the city of New
                            Orleans.
                            Celebrations are
                            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                            Wednesday
                            (the start of lent in
                            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                            permitting); many days have
                            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days
                            of
                            the Mardi Gras season. In
                            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
                            including
                            parades and balls (some
                            of them masquerade balls).
                            <span class="hidden">The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
                                krewes;
                                most follow
                                the
                                same
                                parade schedule and route
                                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                                earliest,
                                Rex,
                                the Knights of Momus and
                                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
                                parades
                                and
                                events, such as the
                                Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for
                                their
                                parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
                                (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid
                                &
                                Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly
                                African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                                common
                                throws are strings of
                                colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                                inexpensive toys. Major krewes
                                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
                                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major
                                parades
                                originate in the Uptown and
                                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
                                upriver
                                side of the French
                                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take
                                place
                                downtown in the Faubourg
                                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day.</span>

                    <br>
                    <p>Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend
                        Xavier University of
                        Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.[3] She attended an executive training program at
                        the Harvard Kennedy
                        School ,Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In
                        2003, she joined the board of the
                        Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the
                        2005 levee failures in
                        Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                        remained mostly
                        deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a
                        blue-ribbon panel convened by
                        then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                        Orleans neighborhoods to be
                        converted into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked
                        with residents and local
                        religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
                        returning Broadmoor
                        residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.</p>
